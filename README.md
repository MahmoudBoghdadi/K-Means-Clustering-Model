# K-Means-Clustering-Model
K-Means Clustering Model for Optimal Cluster Detection Overview This repository contains the implementation of a K-means clustering model developed during my internship at The Spart Foundation. The model is designed for identifying the optimal number of clusters in a dataset and visualizing the clustering results.
