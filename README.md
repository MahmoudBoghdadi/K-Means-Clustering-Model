# K-Means-Clustering-Model

# Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a K-means clustering model developed during my internship at The Spart Foundation. The model is designed for identifying the optimal number of clusters in a dataset and visualizing the clustering results.

# Introduction
The K-means clustering model is a machine learning algorithm that partitions a dataset into distinct groups or clusters. In this project, the model is used to determine the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset and visualize the results.

# Model Training
The model training process is documented in the Jupyter notebook (KMeansClusteringModel.ipynb). This notebook contains the code and explanations for loading the dataset, preprocessing, identifying the optimal number of clusters, and visualizing the clustering results.

# Results
After running the model, the results, including visualizations and insights into the optimal number of clusters, are presented in the Jupyter notebook. Feel free to explore the notebook to understand the clustering patterns and make informed decisions based on the analysis.
